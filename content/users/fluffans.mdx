quote: Overall I'm pleased with the work he did for me! I know what I was asking for was surely not easy, and a lot of it had to be uniquely created for the server specifically. Hycord was very good about keeping me updated throughout the process, and responded quickly to any questions or changes I wanted made. When the bot launched initially, there were a couple hiccups but Hycord immediately got to work fixing it as fast as possible, and I could tell he is very dedicated to doing his best to make everything work as smoothly as possible. Now that it's all been completed, I can definitely say that it came out exactly as I had in mind! I look forward to hopefully working with him again in the future.
