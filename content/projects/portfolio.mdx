# Portfolio Overview

My portfolio, hosted at https://hycord.is-a.dev, serves as a showcase for my web development work. It's a testament to my development chops, chronicling my journey of crafting resilient, user-friendly websites for diverse clients, and demonstrating my growing mastery of various platforms, languages, and tools. Although the portfolio is presently a work in progress, its pages tell the story of challenges encountered and overcome, and the process of turning clients' visions into digital reality.

## Portfolio Features

Having multiple projects under my wing, this React-based portfolio offers visitors an engaging, intuitive experience. The site employs Next.js for server-side rendering, which enhances the website's performance and SEO gains. Each project has its dedicated page detailing its nature, challenges resolved, core features, and crucial learnings.

## Development and Deployment

The languages and tools I used intended to build an efficient, reliable architecture. The portfolio is coded in TypeScript, offering static typing and enhancing code quality and understandability. I leverage GitHub for version control, hosting my growing codebase and providing open access to my work.

Additionally, I use Docker for creating and managing containers, ensuring a smooth, consistent environment across all stages of development, whether it be on my local machine or on any deployment service.

The website's deployment utilizes Railway. Being a fast, secure platform, Railway allows me to effortlessly deploy, run, and scale the portfolio application, presenting an edge over numerous conventional hosting platforms. 

## Future Plans

I'm currently augmenting the portfolio with more of my recent projects, improving the detailing, and continuously refining the user interface for better navigation. I am committed to making the portfolio a comprehensive reflection of my capabilities and growth as a web developer.
