# CosmicVanilla Bot

{/* ![CosmicVanilla Bot](https://example.com/cosmicvanilla-bot.png) */}

CosmicVanilla Bot is a custom Discord bot that I created specifically for the Cosmic Vanilla Minecraft server community. It is designed to enhance the server's Discord experience by providing various useful commands and features.

## Features

- **/create**: This command allows members to create a ticket in the Discord server under 3 categories.


- **/close** (Staff-Only): This command allows staff members to close a ticket in the Discord server.

- **/closerequest** (Staff-Only): Staff members can use this command to close a ticket request.

- **/rank \<user\> \<rank\>** (Admin-Only): Admins and higher-ranking members can utilize this command to assign specific ranks to users on the Minecraft server. However, it is restricted to ranks that can be purchased.

- **/store**: Upon using this command, users receive a direct message containing a link to the Cosmic Vanilla store.

- **/rules**: When triggered, this command sends a direct message to the user, providing them with the server's rules.

- **/play**: This command sends users a tutorial via direct message, explaining how to join the Cosmic Vanilla Minecraft server.

- **/add**: When called, this command adds a user to a ticket.

- **/link**: Through this command, users can conveniently link their Minecraft and Discord accounts.

## Other Features

In addition to the commands, CosmicVanilla Bot offers several other features to improve server management and communication:

- **Event Notifications**: The bot is programmed to send specific messages to the events channel, notifying the @events role about any upcoming events on the Minecraft server. This ensures that all relevant members are informed promptly.

- **Embeds for Important Channels**: The bot generates visually appealing embeds for the rules, information, and applications channels in the Discord server. These embeds help organize and present critical information in a more attractive and accessible manner.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Self-Hosting**: Yes (Docker)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js

## GitHub Repository

I developed and maintain the CosmicVanilla Bot. The source code for the bot can be found in its GitHub repository: [hycord/cv-bot](https://github.com/hycord/cv-bot).

## Deployment

I have deployed the CosmicVanilla Bot on a custom dedicated server, ensuring its availability and reliability for the Cosmic Vanilla Minecraft server community.

## Conclusion

Creating the CosmicVanilla Bot has been an exciting project, allowing me to showcase my skills in bot development and contribute to the Cosmic Vanilla Minecraft server community. I invite you to explore the features of CosmicVanilla Bot and experience the enhanced Discord environment it provides.
